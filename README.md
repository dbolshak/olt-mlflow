## O'Reilly Online Training (OLT) Materials for MLflow

This OLT has four modules. Each one is located in a separate directory with 
its respective README.md file and instructions how to follow the module.

**Note**: For modules 1-3, you'll need [Databricks Community Edition](https://databricks.com/try-databricks). Please register for this
before coming to class if you want to follow and do the labs.

1. [MLflow Tracking](./tracking/README.md)
2. [MLFlow Projects](./projects/README.md)
3. [MLflow Models](./models/README.md)
4. [Model Registry](./model_registery/README.md)

Each module, except module 4, has both [Databricks Community Edition](https://databricks.com/try-databricks) notebooks in its `dbc` format 
and equivalent Jupyter notebook versions, with very mild variations. For the most part, you can run Jupyter 
notebooks on your local host, after installing the requirements explained in the 
`README.md` files in the respective `<module>/notebooks/jupyter` directory.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the flow!

Cheers,

Jules S. Damji
